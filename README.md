# OpenGL - Game Engine

## Introduction

In the last module of my diploma at SAE Institute ZÃ¼rich, we looked at Graphics Programming and how game engines are structured behind the scenes.
For my assignment I worked on this rendering engine that is built upon giawas opengl4csharp framework: https://github.com/giawa/opengl4csharp

## Functionality

The game engine currently includes following features:

- Efficient loading of 3D-Models that are in the Wavefront OBJ - Format.
- Switching between different scenes
- Input Handling
- Moveable camera
- UI
- Directional lights
- Point lights
- Lit shaders using Blinn-Phong-Modell
- Support for Normalmaps
- Automatic calculation of tangent and bitangent when loading 3D-Models.
- Skybox and skybox mirror

## Self-reflection

For my studies I also wrote a document where I explain in detail what my learnings, struggles and thoughts on the future of this project are.
You can find it inside the Documents folder under the root directory.
